I am a Ph.D. candidate in the department of Decision Sciences and Managerial Economics (Information System Stream) at [the Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://grad.bschool.cuhk.edu.hk/programmes/decision-sciences-managerial-economics/). I am incredibly fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Xiaoquan (Michael) Zhang](https://mikezhang.com) and [Prof. Keongtae Kim](https://keongkim.github.io). Prior to joining Ph.D. program, I obtained my bachelorâ€™s degree at [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/) in China.
