Hi! 

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the department of [Decision Sciences and Managerial Economics](https://grad.bschool.cuhk.edu.hk/programmes/decision-sciences-managerial-economics/) (Information System Stream) at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. I am incredibly fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Xiaoquan (Michael) Zhang](https://mikezhang.com) and [Prof. Keongtae Kim](https://keongkim.github.io). Prior to joining Ph.D. program, I obtained my bachelorâ€™s degree at [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/) in China.

My **CV** could be found [here](https://miaozhehan99.github.io/assets/CV_MiaozheHAN.pdf).

My research interest revolves around the economic implications of emerging technologies, with a particular focus on artificial intelligence and contributing algorithms. My current studies evaluate the impact of new technologies being deployed in various contexts, such as social media and industrial production. While appraising their value, I endeavor to discuss potential sources of inefficiencies and offer corresponding ways of mitigations. 

As part of IS explorations, I am also broadly interested in digital platforms: how ever-changing technologies reshape user behaviors and social interactions on the platform, and how platforms help realize and even spur sustainable innovations.
