Hi! My first name is 妙哲 or "Meow-Juh" :) 

I am currently an Assistant Professor of Information Systems at the HKUST Business School.

My research interest revolves around the economic implications of emerging technologies, with a particular focus on artificial intelligence and contributing algorithms. My current studies evaluate the impact of prediction machines being deployed in various contexts, such as social media and industrial production. While appraising their value, I endeavor to discuss potential sources of inefficiencies and offer corresponding ways to improve. 

As part of IS exploration, I am also broadly interested in digital platforms: how ever-changing technologies reshape user behaviors and social interactions on the platform, and how platforms help realize and even spur sustainable innovations. 

I obtained my PhD degree from the CUHK Business School and my undergraduate degree from Fudan University in mainland China. My **CV** could be found [here](https://miaozhehan99.github.io/assets/CV_MiaozheHAN.pdf).
