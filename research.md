### Artificial Intelligence and Firm Resilience: Evidence from Firm Performance under Disaster Shocks ###
 
(with Hongchuan Shen, Jing Wu, and Xiaoquan Michael Zhang)

Major Revision at __*Information Systems Research*__

> **Abstract**: Artificial intelligence (AI) has been widely implemented in business operations over the past decade. While AI value in normal times is extensively studied, direct evidence of its effectiveness in turbulent times is limited. Our work fills this gap by focusing on the contribution of AI to corporate resilience. Specifically, we measure firm AI investments by the cumulative demands of AI-related skills extracted from a comprehensive job posting database. We gauge firm resilience with the unexpected changes in corporate valuation induced by severe shocks from natural disasters. Using an event study approach, we find that AI generates resilience: an average firm that demands 2.2\% of total jobs to be AI-related could approximately recover the full damage of disasters reflected in corporate valuation. Then, we explore mechanisms under the framework of an adapted production function. Our evidence suggests that during turbulent periods, deployment of AI moderates the hard-hit inventory turnover and sales revenue, therefore improving income stability, especially for firms with larger capital constraints. To address endogeneity in AI investment, we further construct an instrumental variable that combines the within-firm geographical variation of employment with the arguably exogenous across-firm regional variation of AI development. In summary, our paper identifies an important aspect of AI effectiveness -- AI provides companies with resilience in tough times by improving operational agility and relieving capital constraints. <br> **Keywords**: economics of AI, firm production, event study, production function, instrumental variable

> **Abstract**: In this project, we investigate algorithm-induced information misallocation in the online context. We empirically examine archival data and conduct a large-scale field experiment on Facebook. We find that instead of informing the poorly informed, information is systematically more likely to be distributed to those who are already well informed. With a set of laboratory tests, we identify the cause of this misallocation: algorithms tend to maximize user online engagement, while overlooking the inherent discrepancy between user interests and user needs. Specifically, our results consistently show that individuals with the highest informational needs are not covered by the current algorithms, leading to their exclusion from the allocation pool. Our welfare analysis suggests that allocating more information to the poorly informed can potentially improve efficiency through increased user willingness-to-pay. Overall, our study suggests that it would be socially desirable if content providers were allowed to reveal whether their content pertains to entertainment or information. <br> **Keywords**: recommendation algorithm, information misallocation, field test, difference-in-differences, lab experiment

### Connecting Communities: Semi-supervised Node Classification on Disconnected and Unevenly-labeled Networks ###
 
(with Tianyi Li and Jeremy Yang)

Under Review

> **Abstract**: Having limited labels is a common challenge for semi-supervised classification when labels are difficult to collect. When subjects are connected on a network, we can exploit graph connectivity to improve prediction accuracy. However, the network might also be hard to measure and is only partially observed, often resulting in disconnected communities with unevenly distributed labels. To address this issue, we treat the observed, fragmented network as downsampled from a connected background network, and augment it with additional edges, in particular, inter-community edges; we then use graph neural network (GNN) to infer the missing labels on the augmented network. We experiment with three edge augmentation methods: link prediction, eigenvalue elevation, and random edge rewiring. We apply our framework to the Paluck et al. (2016) and Alatas et al. (2016) datasets to predict students' anti-bullying behaviors and the need for financial aid in Indonesian villages. We show that GNN's accuracy is higher on the augmented network than on the original or the feature-selected network, especially when labels are more limited, more unevenly distributed, and the network is more fragmented. Link prediction which leverages both node features and graph connectivity works the best. We further show that edge augmentation can preserve the original graph topology and render the predicted label distribution closer to the ground truth. We discuss research limitations and directions for future work. <br> **Keywords**: limited labels problem, semi-supervised classification, graph neural networks, disconnected graphs, edge augmentation

### The Blessing of High Price: A Field Experiment on E-Commerce Platform ###
 
(with Jie Song, Siqi Pei, Xiaoquan Michael Zhang, and Feng Zhu)

> **Abstract**: We challenge the ubiquitous belief that sales promotion strategy necessarily resides in low-price practices such as markdowns or discounts. From a randomized field experiment on a leading e-commerce platform in China, we investigate the hypothesis that high-price promotion strategy, which is realized via concealing low-priced items on the front-page, may also effectively yield sales increase. Results demonstrate that high-price promotion induces consumers to browse, cart, and order higher-priced products, among which the products being actively searched for (as opposed to being passively showcased by the platform) dominate the effect. More interestingly, we find that search efforts of consumers, as measured by the exploitative browsing duration and the exploratory browsing diversity, remain unchanged. Heterogeneity tests show that less-explorative and smaller users tend to react more positively. We attribute our findings to the deviation of consumer’s perceived value of high-priced items when low-priced ones are unavailable. Our findings imply that sales can be potentially augmented by strategically promoting higher-priced products. <br> **Keywords**: digital platform, promotion strategy, consumer behavior, field experiment, lab experiment

### The Impact of Live-Streaming on Business Performance: Evidence from an E-Commerce Platform ###
 
(with Mingi Song, Gun Wonng Lee, Keongtae Kim)

> **Abstract**: The widespread adoption of live shopping on e-commerce platforms has created opportunities for sellers to reach broader audiences and increase sales. Using a comprehensive dataset of sellers’ live shopping practices, this study examines the effect of live shopping on sellers in two major product categories on Korea’s largest e-commerce platform. Our findings indicate a positive impact on sales for broadcasting sellers during livestreaming events. In addition, we find significant temporal changes in sales even before and after livestreaming dates. Our findings suggest that live shopping acts as an informational discovery channel that helps attract and retain customer attention. Furthermore, we investigate the aggregate impact on platform growth and find that livestreams have a positive effect not only on livestreaming sellers but also on non-streaming stores, contributing to sustainable platform growth. These findings underscore the potential of live shopping as an effective tool to influence sales on e-commerce platforms. <br> **Keywords**: digital platform, live streaming, difference-in-differences

### Trade and Foreign Economic Policy Uncertainty in Supply Chain Networks: Who Comes Home ###
 
(with Ben Charoenwong and Jing Wu)

__*Manufacturing & Service Operations Management, 25 (1)*__

> **Abstract**: The uncertainty around trade and foreign economic policy contributes to supply chain risk. Whether such policy uncertainty will bring some production back to the United States or only redistribute the global supply chains among foreign sources is theoretically ambiguous and warrants an empirical analysis. In this paper, we study the relationship between trade and foreign economic policy uncertainty and the supply chain networks of American firms. We use firm-level global supply chain data, transaction-level shipping container data, and policy uncertainty indexes constructed from leading media outlets to study how policy uncertainty correlates with changes in supply chain networks. When U.S. trade policy uncertainty rises, firms with majority domestic sales decrease their supplier base abroad, whereas firms with majority foreign sales increase the number of foreign suppliers. Firms also substitute among foreign countries in response to their respective economic policy uncertainty—shifting suppliers from countries with higher uncertainty to ones with lower uncertainty. Firms requiring more specific inputs, producing more differentiated products, having higher market shares, and more central to the production network are more sensitive to policy uncertainty. Supply chain restructuring following higher policy uncertainty puts the market value at risk. Managers should consider customers’ locations when making global supply chain restructuring decisions. <br> **Keywords**: supply chain network, economic policy uncertainty

### Passion Matters but not Equally Everywhere: Predicting Achievement from Interest, Enjoyment, and Efficacy in 59 Societies ###

(with Xingyu Li, Geoffrey L Cohen, and Hazel Rose Markus)

__*Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 118 (11)*__

> **Abstract**: How to identify the students and employees most likely to achieve is a challenge in every field. American academic and lay theories alike highlight the importance of passion for strong achievement. Based on a Western independent model of motivation, passionate individuals—those who have a strong interest, demonstrate deep enjoyment, and express confidence in what they are doing—are considered future achievers. Those with less passion are thought to have less potential and are often passed over for admission or employment. As academic institutions and corporations in the increasingly multicultural world seek to acquire talent from across the globe, can they assume that passion is an equally strong predictor of achievement across cultural contexts? We address this question with three representative samples totaling 1.2 million students in 59 societies and provide empirical evidence of a systematic, cross-cultural variation in the importance of passion in predicting achievement. In individualistic societies where independent models of motivation are prevalent, relative to collectivistic societies where interdependent models of motivation are more common, passion predicts a larger gain (0.32 vs. 0.21 SD) and explains more variance in achievement (37% vs. 16%). In contrast, in collectivistic societies, parental support predicts achievement over and above passion. These findings suggest that in addition to passion, achievement may be fueled by striving to realize connectedness and meet family expectations. Findings highlight the risk of overweighting passion in admission and employment decisions and the need to understand and develop measures for the multiple sources and forms of motivation that support achievement. <br> **Keywords**: culture, passion, achievement, hierarchical linear model

### The impact of government regulation on sharing platform growth: A channel of supplier behavior change ###

(with Xiaoquan Michael Zhang)

__*ICIS 2020 Proceedings*__

> **Abstract**: There has been practical debates over the sharing economy and government intervention. Applying a difference-in-differences approach on Airbnb listing records in 20 U.S. cities from 2015 to 2020, we conclude a negative impact of government regulation on platform growth, through a channel of supplier behavior change. Our empirical analysis finds that implementation of license policy causes a significant decrease in the individual supplier activeness, quantified by 3.04% lower response rate, 3.22-hour longer response time and 4.71% lower acceptance rate. Subsequently, the change in behaviors leads to reduced revenue at host level and depressed booking demand, an estimate of 648 fewer requests each month, at platform level. We provide mechanisms by which the supplier-behavior channel exists, and discuss managerial implications for local policymakers and platform managers. <br> **Keywords**: digital platform, supplier behavior, policy regulation, difference-in-differences
