#### Artificial Intelligence and Firm Resilience: Evidence from Firm Performance under Disaster Shocks
(with Hongchuan Shen, Jing Wu, and Xiaoquan Michael Zhang)

Major Revision at *Information Systems Research*

> Artificial intelligence (AI) has been widely implemented in business operations over the past decade. While AI value in normal times is extensively studied, direct evidence of its effectiveness in turbulent times is limited. Our work fills this gap by focusing on the contribution of AI to corporate resilience. Specifically, we measure firm AI investments by the cumulative demands of AI-related skills extracted from a comprehensive job posting database. We gauge firm resilience with the unexpected changes in corporate valuation induced by severe shocks from natural disasters. Using an event study approach, we find that AI generates resilience: an average firm that demands 2.2\% of total jobs to be AI-related could approximately recover the full damage of disasters reflected in corporate valuation. Then, we explore mechanisms under the framework of an adapted production function. Our evidence suggests that during turbulent periods, deployment of AI moderates the hard-hit inventory turnover and sales revenue, therefore improving income stability, especially for firms with larger capital constraints. To address endogeneity in AI investment, we further construct an instrumental variable that combines the within-firm geographical variation of employment with the arguably exogenous across-firm regional variation of AI development. In summary, our paper identifies an important aspect of AI effectiveness -- AI provides companies with resilience in tough times by improving operational agility and relieving capital constraints.
