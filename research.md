### Artificial Intelligence and Firm Resilience: Evidence from Firm Performance under Disaster Shocks ###
 
(with Hongchuan Shen, Jing Wu, and Xiaoquan Michael Zhang)

Major Revision at __*Information Systems Research*__

> **Abstract**: Artificial intelligence (AI) has been widely implemented in business operations over the past decade. While AI value in normal times is extensively studied, direct evidence of its effectiveness in turbulent times is limited. Our work fills this gap by focusing on the contribution of AI to corporate resilience. Specifically, we measure firm AI investments by the cumulative demands of AI-related skills extracted from a comprehensive job posting database. We gauge firm resilience with the unexpected changes in corporate valuation induced by severe shocks from natural disasters. Using an event study approach, we find that AI generates resilience: an average firm that demands 2.2\% of total jobs to be AI-related could approximately recover the full damage of disasters reflected in corporate valuation. Then, we explore mechanisms under the framework of an adapted production function. Our evidence suggests that during turbulent periods, deployment of AI moderates the hard-hit inventory turnover and sales revenue, therefore improving income stability, especially for firms with larger capital constraints. To address endogeneity in AI investment, we further construct an instrumental variable that combines the within-firm geographical variation of employment with the arguably exogenous across-firm regional variation of AI development. In summary, our paper identifies an important aspect of AI effectiveness -- AI provides companies with resilience in tough times by improving operational agility and relieving capital constraints. <br> **Keywords**: economics of AI, firm production, event study, production function, instrumental variable

> **Abstract**: In this project, we investigate algorithm-induced information misallocation in the online context. We empirically examine archival data and conduct a large-scale field experiment on Facebook. We find that instead of informing the poorly informed, information is systematically more likely to be distributed to those who are already well informed. With a set of laboratory tests, we identify the cause of this misallocation: algorithms tend to maximize user online engagement, while overlooking the inherent discrepancy between user interests and user needs. Specifically, our results consistently show that individuals with the highest informational needs are not covered by the current algorithms, leading to their exclusion from the allocation pool. Our welfare analysis suggests that allocating more information to the poorly informed can potentially improve efficiency through increased user willingness-to-pay. Overall, our study suggests that it would be socially desirable if content providers were allowed to reveal whether their content pertains to entertainment or information. <br> **Keywords**: recommendation algorithm, information misallocation, field test, difference-in-differences, lab experiment
